### Userstory 1: List overview
An employee wants to have access to a current overview list. This overview list should include 
selected data about current needed data sets. In special cases the office management want to access this list 
on a mobile device or they want to print those list.

- Lisa wants to provide a list of current class for e.g. lecturers.
- Norbert wants to get a room list for his maintenance work.

Currently only trained employees are able to extend data source, e.g. to add new data sets to a specific file format.

### Userstory 2: Search
The amount of data will increase really fast. Lisa and Norbert want 
an easy way to get only a subset of data. Lists will be too long to work efficiantly, if they include all datasets,
e.g. all participantscountabout4500.A search field in the overview is necessary to show only matching results.
 
- Lisa most search request is to look for participants of a selected course.
- Norbert has to know which rooms were maintained first, because they are regulary maintained(light, paint, windows, ...).

### Userstory #3: Inserting new data
Norbert and Lisa want to insert all in formation into the new course management system. 
It's necessary that both are able to add new data, because it's faster and less work 
to directly insert, and also state-of-the-art. Lisa and Norbert want to get access to an 
overview. There they want to search data, before they insert any duplicated entries.
